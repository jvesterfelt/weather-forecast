# weather-forecast

### Description:
A simple web application utilizing an open weather api to allow a user to search a location and have the weather forecast displayed. Up to five past searches will be saved and repopulated when the page is refreshed.

**Note: Search history is limited to five unique search values, and will display all those values upon refreshing the page. Those recent searches are buttons that can be clicked to reload the current data for that location.
